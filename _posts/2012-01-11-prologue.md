4E71 is the opcode for the NOP operation in the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. It's an assembly instruction to do nothing. Although alone it may seem useless, within the context of other opcodes, it provides a valuable function. Similarily, while this blog is about nothing in particular, hopefully someone will find it to be of some small use. 

I have not written assembly since university, thus this manual brings back some fond memories: [Motorola 68K](http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf)
