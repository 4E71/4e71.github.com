4E71 is the opcode for the NOP operation in the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. It's an assembly instruction   
_to_   
_do_  
_nothing_.    
Although something that does nothing seems useless, within the context of other opcodes, it provides a valuable function. Similarily, while this blog is about nothing in particular, hopefully it will turn out to have some small value. 

**_post scriptum_**  
Although I haven't written assembly since university, this manual is right up there with all the great technical references of our time: [Motorola 68K](http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf) d(^__^)b
