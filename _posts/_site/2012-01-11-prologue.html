<p>4E71 is the opcode for the NOP operation in the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. It&#8217;s an assembly instruction to do nothing. Although alone it may seem useless, within the context of other opcodes, it provides a valuable function. Similarily, while this blog is about nothing in particular, hopefully someone will find it to be of some small use.</p>

<p>I have not written assembly since university, thus this manual brings back some fond memories: <a href='http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf'>Motorola 68K</a></p>
